# Kawach Women Safety

## Abstract
Kawach Women Safety is an AI-driven safety analytics platform designed to enhance women's security in public spaces. With rising cases of crimes against women, real-time monitoring and proactive alert systems are essential for early intervention and prevention. This project utilizes advanced AI and computer vision techniques to detect potential threats and trigger alerts before an incident occurs. Key features include gender classification, gender distribution analysis, lone-woman detection, emergency gesture recognition, and hotspot identification. By leveraging real-time data processing and AI-driven analytics, Kawach Women Safety provides law enforcement and safety authorities with actionable insights to create safer environments for women.

## Introduction
Womenâ€™s safety remains a critical global issue, with increasing crime rates necessitating technological interventions. Kawach Women Safety addresses this concern by employing machine learning and computer vision models to analyze video footage and detect unsafe situations. The system recognizes when a woman is alone in a high-risk area or surrounded by a group of men and identifies distress signals through SOS gesture recognition. Additionally, hotspot identification helps pinpoint locations with repeated safety concerns. The project emphasizes real-time monitoring, ensuring immediate response and intervention.
